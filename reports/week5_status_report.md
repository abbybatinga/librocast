# Week 4 Status Report

- Team report

  1. Goals from the last week

     - Determine software architecture and design - all members
     - Get infrastructure set up for all members - all members
     - Solidify UI design - frontend team
     - Have a relatively nondescript, broad understanding of how to implement a component based on research - backend team
     - UML diagram-level, translating hypothetical design to pseudocode. Have some idea of what would be difficult to implement - backend team
     - People should start looking into React and planning how to set up their components - frontend team
     - Next week's specification should be read before Thursday - all members

  2. We finished setting up react app and the backend server. Frontend team added and developed feed, explore, and profile pages for the wireframes. By discussing and sharing thoughts in class, we could improve and solidify the UI design in detail. We figured out that we will be using Kaggle's goodreads book data instead of Google Books. The first feature we choosed to develop is user sign up and login feature using Firebase Authentication.

  3. Goals:
     - Add user sign up and login using Google Firebase

- Contributions of individual team members

  - Abigail Batinga
    1. Goals from the last week:
    - finalize the wireframe
    - start looking into our data model
    - do some planning for the backend
    - learn more about the instagram API
    2. This week, I helped improve the wireframe and got the basic react app with firebase setup. I also setup the trello board and set tasks for team members this week.
    3. For the following week, I'd like to:
    - finish the wireframe
    - code the onboarding and register/login frontend
    - code the home page

       - Next week's specification should be read before Thursday
    2. This week, I got about halfway through the W3School JavScript tutorial. Updated the "explore page" figma diagram. Was kinda unsure where to look
       into code-wise, but the Tuesday meeting was helpful for that
    3. Look into Firebase, Instagram API, maybe see how it connects to react

    1. Goals from the last week
       - Research how to set up the backend environment to develop our projectâ€™s server efficiently and share it with our backend team.
       - Design basic software architecture and write pseudocodes for the tasks I am assigned.
       - Practice Node.js and JavaScript before start implementing real features.
    2. This week, I read JavaScript documents and practiced it to get used to its syntax. I also studied the features in Node.js for the server development to prepare myself to start coding next week. It was confusing to figure out how to set up the working environment for both react and node.js.
    3. Goals:

    - Implement user registration and login validation using Google Firebase.

  - Alyssa Allums
    1. Goals from the last week:
       - Architecture setup
       - Review React
       - Determine any dependencies for book component, search page, feed page
       - General design for these pages, what components will be necessary
    2. This week I read over resources for React, Firestore/Firebase, and the fetch API to get familiar with the tools we will be using
       and prepare for this week's objective of creative the search page.
    3. Goals:
       - Create front end for search page
  - Sarah Rashid
    1. Last week's goals:
       - Get an initial design of explore and profile pages
       - Determine functionality of explore and profile pages
       - Read React documents
    2. This week I worked on the wireframe for the application pages. We revised the functionality of the Explore and Feed pages. I also worked on the profile page and posts. We talked as a team about functionality of these pages as part of our MVP. I also read about React to get familiar with the framework.
    3. Goals:
       - Finish Figma wireframe
       - Create front end for profile page
  - Kihoon Lee
    1. Last week's goals:
       - Implement book search and book filter feature on the backend side
       - Study more NodeJS and how to connect to the firebase
    2. For this week, I have implemented book search feature with Nodejs. The book search feature search the csv dataset with the given title of a book and returns information about the book if it is in the dataset. The information includes ISBN, author, average rating, genre, and many others. Additionally, I have studies more of Nodejs so reorganized the backend directories so each teammates can easily understand the structure of our backend.
    3. Goals:
       - Implement user search in addition to current book search feature
       - Add more routes and controllers to meet our requirements
       - Practice more with Nodejs
