# Week 5 Status Report

- Team report

  1. Goals from the last week

     - Add user sign up and login using Google Firebase

  2. To build on top of last week's implementation, the frontend team developed and reorganized react components structure. The backend team implemented user authentication such as signup and login and book search feature so we can connect the frontend and backend easily in the future.

  3. Goals:

     - Add user search feature in addition to book search

- Contributions of individual team members

    1. Goals from last week

    3. Goals:
       - Need to figure out how to "SQLize" the Firebase queries.
       - Can create some skeleton files for Firebase
       - Should look how to "SQLize" FileStream (for the GoodReads database, which is currently implemented as CSV)
  - Tommy Chung

    1. Last week's goals:
       - Finish Figma wireframe
       - Create front end for profile page
    2. This week I worked on the Figma wireframe and began implementing the profile page. For the wireframe, I added a new feature for profiles called "bookshelf" which will store a user's to be read, completed, and in progress books. For implementation for the profile page I have begun working on the front end design.
    3. Goals:
      - Develop personal profile UI and retrieving user info
      - Work on profile bookshelf
  - Kihoon Lee
    1. Last week's goals:
       - Implement book search and book filter feature on the backend side
       - Study more NodeJS and how to connect to the firebase
    2. For this week, I have implemented book search feature with Nodejs. The book search feature search the csv dataset with the given title of a book and returns information about the book if it is in the dataset. The information includes ISBN, author, average rating, genre, and many others. Additionally, I have studies more of Nodejs so reorganized the backend directories so each teammates can easily understand the structure of our backend.
    3. Goals:
       - Implement user search in addition to current book search feature
       - Add more routes and controllers to meet our requirements
       - Practice more with Nodejs
