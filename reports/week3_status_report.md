# Week 3 Status Report

- Team report
  1. The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). 
  It can be empty for the first week.
  2. The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, 
  and where you are stuck.
  3. The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. 
  If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
  For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. 
  Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.
