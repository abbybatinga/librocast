# Week 3 Status Report

- Team report
  1. N/A
  2. The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, 
  and where you are stuck.
  3. Goals:
        * Determine software architecture and design - all members
        * Get infrastructure set up for all members - all members
        * Solidify UI design

- Contributions of individual team members

    1. The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). 
    It can be empty for the first week.
    2. The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, 
    and where you are stuck.
    3. The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. 
    If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
    For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. 
    Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

    2. For this first week I contributed to the group discussion and project documents as we planned our project and
    defined aspects of our workflow. I took on a role for frontend development and am responsible for developing a book
    component, the search page, and the feed page. Along with the rest of the team I worked on the requirements
    document.
    3. Goals:
       * Architecture setup  
       * Review React  
       * Determine any dependencies for book component, search page, feed page  
       * General design for these pages, what components will be necessary
