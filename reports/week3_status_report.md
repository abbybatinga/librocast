# Week 3 Status Report

- Team report
  1. N/A
  2. During the first week our group defined our project, our workflow, and our plan. Building on top of the project
  proposal we refined the concept for the app, determining the core features, general tasks we need to accomplish,
  and roles for each member. We made decisions regarding our toolset, choosing to use React for frontend, Node.js for backend,
  and Google Firebase for data store. For communication, organization, and development we set up our slack channel, a Trello board,
  and our GitHub. We also finished the requirements doc this week. Communicating on slack and assigning individuals homework (each person writes their own use case) was effective.
  Meetings are relatively low-activity/impromptu.
  
  3. Goals:
        * Determine software architecture and design - all members
        * Get infrastructure set up for all members - all members
        * Solidify UI design - frontend team
        * Have a relatively nondescript, broad understanding of how to implement a component based on research - backend team
        * UML diagram-level, translating hypothetical design to pseudocode. Have some idea of what would be difficult to implement - backend team
        * People should start looking into React and planning how to set up their components - frontend team
        * Next week's specification should be read before Thursday - all members

- Contributions of individual team members

    1. The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). 
    It can be empty for the first week.
    2. For the first week, I helped complete the requirements and policies, focusing mainly on solidifying external requirements and use cases, as well as delegating responsibilities and roles. I also did some research into the technicalities of certain services and features we'd like to implement. 
    3. For the following week, I'd like to:
      - finalize the wireframe
      - start looking into our data model
      - do some planning for the backend
      - learn more about the instagram API
    If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
    For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. 
    Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

    1. N/A
    2. For this first week I wrote my use case, discussed backend goals, and did some cohesive/grammatical revisions for the Requirements documentation. Slack communication was responsive and there were no conflicts of interest when revising the Requirments documentation.
    3. Goals:
       - Start looking into React and how to connect it to Google Firebase
       - I should read the next assignment's specifications before the next meeting

    2. This week,  as I first joined in the team, I read Project Proposal previously written by team members. I asked questions and proposed some ideas
    regarding it. I also worked on the requirements and policies, particularly the user case and three major risks. I didn’t really have trouble or got
    stuck so far, but I am concerned about the technical tasks starting next week.
    4.  Goals:
        - Research how to set up the backend environment to develop our project’s server efficiently and share it with our backend team. 
        - Design basic software architecture and write pseudocodes for the tasks I am assigned.
        - Practice Node.js and JavaScript before start implementing real features.

    2. For this first week I contributed to the group discussion and project documents as we planned our project and
    defined aspects of our workflow. I took on a role for frontend development and am responsible for developing a book
    component, the search page, and the feed page. Along with the rest of the team I worked on the requirements
    document. So far I feel our slack communication and Google doc collaboration has worked well and did not feel stuck
    or face any issues.
    3. Goals:
       * Architecture setup  
       * Review React  
       * Determine any dependencies for book component, search page, feed page  
       * General design for these pages, what components will be necessary

    2. For this first week I completed one use case of our application, contributed to project requirements and team policies
    document, and researched possible API and Node.js modules for audio streaming. Although I have a quite of experience in Java and Go
    to implment backend features, I have very little experience in Node.js. Therefore, one challenge for this quarter would be studying 
    Node.js well enough to implment our application's backend feature correctly.
    3. Goals:
       * Node.js Module and API Research
       * Study Node.js
       * Design a high level structure of backend implementation.
