# Week 4 Status Report

- Team report
  1. Goals from the last week
        * Determine software architecture and design - all members
        * Get infrastructure set up for all members - all members
        * Solidify UI design - frontend team
        * Have a relatively nondescript, broad understanding of how to implement a component based on research - backend team
        * UML diagram-level, translating hypothetical design to pseudocode. Have some idea of what would be difficult to implement - backend team
        * People should start looking into React and planning how to set up their components - frontend team
        * Next week's specification should be read before Thursday - all members
 
  2. We finished setting up react app and the backend server. Frontend team added and developed feed, explore, and profile pages for the wireframes. By discussing and sharing thoughts in class, we could improve and solidify the UI design in detail. We figured out that we will be using Kaggle's goodreads book data instead of Google Books. The first feature we choosed to develop is user sign up and login feature using Firebase Authentication.
  
  3. Goals:
        * Add user sign up and login using Google Firebase

- Contributions of individual team members
  * Abigail Batinga
    1. Goals from the last week:
      - finalize the wireframe
      - start looking into our data model
      - do some planning for the backend
      - learn more about the instagram API
    2. This week, I helped improve the wireframe and got the basic react app with firebase setup. I also setup the trello board and set tasks for team members this week. 
    3. For the following week, I'd like to:
      - finish the wireframe
      - code the onboarding and register/login frontend
      - code the home page
  * Justin Chao
    1. N/A
    2. For this first week I wrote my use case, discussed backend goals, and did some cohesive/grammatical revisions for the Requirements documentation. Slack communication was responsive and there were no conflicts of interest when revising the Requirments documentation.
    3. Goals:
       - Start looking into React and how to connect it to Google Firebase
       - I should read the next assignment's specifications before the next meeting
  * Tommy Chung
    1. Goals from the last week
        - Research how to set up the backend environment to develop our projectâ€™s server efficiently and share it with our backend team. 
        - Design basic software architecture and write pseudocodes for the tasks I am assigned.
        - Practice Node.js and JavaScript before start implementing real features.
    2. This week, I read JavaScript documents and practiced it to get used to its syntax. I also studied the features in Node.js for the server development to prepare myself to start coding next week. It was confusing to figure out how to set up the working environment for both react and node.js.
    3. Goals:
      * Implement user registration and login validation using Google Firebase.

  * Alyssa Allums
    1. N/A
    2. For this first week I contributed to the group discussion and project documents as we planned our project and
    defined aspects of our workflow. I took on a role for frontend development and am responsible for developing a book
    component, the search page, and the feed page. Along with the rest of the team I worked on the requirements
    document. So far I feel our slack communication and Google doc collaboration has worked well and did not feel stuck
    or face any issues.
    3. Goals:
       * Architecture setup  
       * Review React  
       * Determine any dependencies for book component, search page, feed page  
       * General design for these pages, what components will be necessary 
  * Sarah Rashid
    1. Last week's goals:
       * Get an initial design of explore and profile pages
       * Determine functionality of explore and profile pages
       * Read React documents
    2. This week I worked on the wireframe for the application pages. We revised the functionality of the Explore and Feed pages. I also worked on the profile page and posts. We talked as a team about functionality of these pages as part of our MVP. I also read about React to get familiar with the framework. 
    3. Goals:
       * Finish Figma wireframe 
       * Create front end for profile page
  * Kihoon Lee
    1. N/A
    2. For this first week I completed one use case of our application, contributed to project requirements and team policies
    document, and researched possible API and Node.js modules for audio streaming. Although I have a quite of experience in Java and Go
    to implment backend features, I have very little experience in Node.js. Therefore, one challenge for this quarter would be studying 
    Node.js well enough to implment our application's backend feature correctly.
    3. Goals:
       * Node.js Module and API Research
       * Study Node.js
       * Design a high level structure of backend implementation.
