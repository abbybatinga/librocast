# Librocast

## Overview
> Idea: 
Librocast is a full-stack web application that allows users to create a profile where they can keep track of reading goals, books they’ve read, want to read, and are currently reading, as well as keep up with friends. Through the application, users are able to explore new reads by seeing what their friends are currently reading, what’s trending on social media, and recommendations from other friends. They can also explore books by genre or simply search for books available in the database. They can add personal goals to their profile, keep track of their progress with these goals through their dashboard, and show goals as “badges” on their profile when they’ve accomplished them – as well as share these accomplishments with their community.


> Goals:
- Create a more social community that incentivizes reading consistently such that users form healthy habits around reading
- Connect readers with more personalized and curated book recommendations than existing solutions
- Give readers a "creator" community for reading through live-streamed readings and collaborative book clubs
- Provide an inclusive environment for readers of all levels to get started with reading
